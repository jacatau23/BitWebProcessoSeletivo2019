        I hear the drums echoing tonight<br>
        But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
        She's coming in, 12:30 flight<br>
        The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation<br>
        I stopped an old man along the way<br>
        Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
        He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"<br>
        It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
        There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
        I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
        Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)<br>
        The wild dogs cry out in the night<br>
        As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company<br>
        I know that I must do what's right<br>
        As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti<br>
        I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become<br>
        It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
        There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
        I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
        Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)<br>
        Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you<br>
        It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
        There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
        I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
        I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
        (I bless the rain)<br>
        I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rain)<br>
        I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
        I bless the rains down in Africa (ah, gonna take the time)<br>
        Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)<br>
